# LibPhil README

This is repository of all the utility classes I've written for my own purposes

## Directory Structure

Currently the only directory is src which contains the libs and samples built off of those libs

## Future Plans

* Set up a scripted build system (probably using [Jam][jam-link])
* Decide on a small project and starting building classes and libs as needed.
